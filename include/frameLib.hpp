 * International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS)

 * From SkyField:
 * This is the IAU standard for an Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF)
 * coordinate system, anchored to the Earth’s crust and continents.
 * This reference frame combines three other reference frames: the
 * Earth’s true equator and equinox of date, the Earth’s rotation with
 * respect to the stars, and (if your ``Timescale`` has polar offsets
 * loaded) the polar wobble of the crust with respect to the Earth’s
 * pole of rotation.
